	<h3> What challenges did I face?</h3>
		<p> Well, honetly coming from a background of never using github or html, I had to struggle a little, but the assignment was relatively
	    easy (hopefully I did it right). I worked through both online tutorials for git and github, but it would still be nice for an example to be done in
		class sometime. Also, the HTML tags we went over in class were pretty helpful in getting started. I'm excited to move on and start learning about
		CSS! I am excited to learn more about web development!</p>
	<h3>What did I learn from this assignment?</h3>
		<p> I feel that I have learned the absolute basics of git,github, and HTML. Some useful tags I learned in html: Pagargaphs, unsorted lists,sorted 
		lists, titles, and headers. Useful commands for git: git init, git add, git commit -m, git push origin master, git status, and git clone.</p>
