	<h3> What challenges did I face?</h3>
		<p> Well, honetly coming from a background of never using github or html, I had to struggle a little, and use online resources to 
		be able to complete this assignment (hopefully I did it right). Still pretty excited to learn more about web development!</p>
	<h3>What did I learn from this assignment?</h3>
		<p> I feel that I have learned the absolute basics of git,github, and HTML.</p>
	<h3> Useful resources? </h3>
